--How it works

This app is built in a simple and modular way.
All important logic is clearly written and commented inside the JavaScript file, so:

You can easily change how groups work

You can customize task behavior

You can extend the app with new features

Everything is designed to be easy to read, easy to modify, and easy to improve.

 --App Logic

The application works with:

Groups → each group contains its own tasks

Tasks → can be added, removed, and managed inside groups

Each action (adding, deleting, saving) is handled in a clean and understandable way inside the code.
